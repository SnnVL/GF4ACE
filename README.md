# GF4ACE
Green's function experiments with the [Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE)](https://github.com/ai2cm/ace)


## Usage

### Installation
To install the necessary packages, run
```
conda create -n env fme
conda activate fme
pip install fme
conda install -c conda-forge xcdat
```
See [ACE documentation](https://ai2-climate-emulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about ACE. 

### Data
Checkpoint and forcing data for ACE can be found at the [Ai2 Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/ace-67327d822f0f0d8e0e5e6ca4)

Initial conditions and output data for the Green's function simulations can be found on [Dryad]()

### Running GF4ACE

First, download the necessary data for the model checkpoints, forcing files, and initial conditions. To create the climatology for ACE2-ERA5, run `./forcing/create_ERA5_control.py`. Forcing files should be stored in `./forcing/<model>/control/forcing.nc`. Initial conditions should be stored in `./initialization/<model>/20191231_1800.nc`.

All model settings are stored in `_model_settings.py`.

To perform all patch simulation for a certain `<model>` and `<patch_amplitude>`:
```run_all_patches.sh <model> <patch_amplitude>```
Patch perturbations will be created automatically, or can be created for a certain `<model>` and patch amplitude `<patch_amplitude>` by running `python create_patches.py <model> <patch_amplitude>`. Patch perturbations will be stored in `./forcing/<model>/GFMIP_patches_<patch_amplitude>K.nc`. 

Finally, `make_GF_yearly.ipynb` contains the code to make the Green's functions and the reconstructions.
